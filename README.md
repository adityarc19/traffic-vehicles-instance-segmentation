# Real time instance segmentation with YOLACT++

**This is a real time instance segmentation task implemented with YOLACT++ and DCNv2 on Google Colab.**

YOLACT (You Only Look At Coefficients) is a simple, fully convolutional model for real-time instance segmentation. The latest version of it which was released on 16th Decemeber 2019, is called YOLACT++. It currently supports two backbone networks : Resnet50-FPN and Resnet101-FPN. I have used Resnet50 version for this project.
